# Vehicle Ordering System

Welcome to the Vehicle Ordering System! This project is designed to streamline the process of ordering vehicles with optional features.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a user-friendly platform for customers to order vehicles online. 
It offers a variety of vehicle types and optional features, allowing users to customize their orders according to their preferences.

## Development Process

The development of the Vehicle Ordering System follows a structured process:

1. **Requirements Gathering**: The project starts with gathering requirements from stakeholders, including users
2. and administrators. This phase helps define the scope and features of the system.

3. **Design**: Once the requirements are gathered, the system architecture is designed. This includes defining the
4. database schema, creating class diagrams, and designing user interfaces.

5. **Implementation**: The system is implemented according to the design specifications. This involves coding the
6. backend logic, creating frontend interfaces, and integrating the various components of the system.

7. **Testing**: Testing is a crucial phase of the development process. It involves unit testing individual components,
8. integration testing to ensure different parts of the system work together, and user acceptance testing to validate
9. that the system meets user requirements.

10. **Deployment**: After successful testing, the system is deployed to a production environment. This involves setting
11. up servers, configuring databases, and ensuring the system is accessible to users.

12. **Maintenance**: Once the system is live, it requires ongoing maintenance. This includes monitoring for bugs and
13. issues, applying updates and patches, and adding new features based on user feedback.

## Structure

The project is structured into several components:

1. **Vehicle Classes**: Classes representing different types of vehicles, including Sedans, Trucks, SUVs, and Minivans.
   Each vehicle class has attributes such as model, color, year, and base price, along with methods for calculating the
   final price and converting data to CSV format.

2. **Feature Packages**: A class representing optional features that customers can add to their vehicle orders. Features
   include enhanced safety features, security systems, entertainment systems, and sunroofs.

3. **Order Management**: Classes for managing orders, including creating, updating, and retrieving orders. Orders consist
   of a vehicle and an optional feature package.

4. **Repositories**: Classes for reading and writing vehicle and order data to and from CSV files. Repositories handle
   serialization and deserialization of data, providing a bridge between the application and persistent storage.

## Getting Started
